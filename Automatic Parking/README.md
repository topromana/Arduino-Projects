The user controlls the robot with the help of his mobile phone, that is connected to the robot with the help of a bluetooth module. 


The robot mimics the behaviour of a car, by going forward when the user commands that, or performing a side park, going front first or back first, on the left hand side or the right hand side, depending on where the desired parking spot is.The robot also knows how to exit from that parking space when needed.


We also used an LED circle to simulate the headlights and the signaling that a real car would have depending on the maneuvers it performs in traffic.


The code was written for the Arduino Uno board.
