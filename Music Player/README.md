The music player reads all the songs that we want to play from an SD card, where the songs are stored in a wav 8bit format, with a 32khz frequency. 

The user chooses which song to play with the help of one of the six buttons available, and the LCD 3.2" display shows the user which button corresponds to each song title.

The code was developed for an Arduino Mega 2560 board.
