# Arduino-Projects
This repository contains two projects. One of them represents a music player that can be commanded with the help of six buttons, reading the music from an SD card and displaying everything on a 3.2" LCD display.


The other project represents a robot that can be controlled from your mobile phone via Bluetooth, commanding the robot which type of parking you want it to perform, just like a real life car.
